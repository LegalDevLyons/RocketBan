ðŸš€ RocketBan

RocketBan is a modular, high-performance wrapper for Fail2Ban that enhances brute-force protection across Linux servers. It monitors authentication logs in real time, detects suspicious patterns using customizable regex rules, and dynamically applies IP bans via iptables or nftables. Whether you're running a personal VPS or managing enterprise infrastructure, RocketBan gives you fast, flexible, and reliable intrusion preventionâ€”with just the right amount of attitude.
