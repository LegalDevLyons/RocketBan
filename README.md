# RocketBan
A lightweight, modular Fail2Ban wrapper that monitors authentication logs, detects brute-force attempts via regex-based pattern matching, and enforces dynamic IP bans in real time using iptables or nftables, with support for timed unbans, multi-service configs, and optional threat feed integration.
